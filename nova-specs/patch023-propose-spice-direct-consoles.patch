+libvirt SPICE direct consoles
+==========================================
+
+https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/libvirt-spice-direct-consoles
+
+This specification proposes modifications to Nova's libvirt driver to support
+"direct" SPICE VDI consoles. These consoles are "direct" in that they are not
+intended to use a HTML5 transcoding proxy to access, and instead the user would
+use a native SPICE client like `remote-viewer`. Such a facility enables a much
+richer virtual desktop experience that Nova current supports, in return for
+relatively minor changes to Nova.
+
+Problem description
+===================
+
+The SPICE protocol was added to Nova a long time ago, and still represents the
+richest and most performant option for remote desktops using Nova. However at
+the moment, Horizon's HTML5 transcoding proxy is the only way to access these
+SPICE consoles, and the HTML5 interface does not support many of the more novel
+features of the SPICE protocol, nor does it support high resolution desktops
+well.
+
+The proposed solution is relatively simple -- add an API microversion which
+makes it possible to create a "spice-direct" console, and to lookup connection
+details for that console from the API. The new console type and microversion is
+required because we need to be able to lookup both the insecure and secure TCP
+ports for the console, as well as the hypervisor IP address. While this is
+similar to what the HTML5 proxy does, it is distinct enough to require an
+API change.
+
+This specification also covers tweaks the to the libvirt domain XML to enrich
+the desktop experience provided by such a direct console, such as:
+
+  * requiring an encrypted connection
+  * allowing concurrent users as supported by SPICE
+  * USB device passthrough from client to guest
+  * sound support
+
+The proposed changes allow direct connection to a SPICE console from a SPICE
+native client like `remote-viewer`. Without additional software, this implies
+that such a client would have network connectivity to relatively arbitrary TCP
+ports on the hypervisor hosting the instance. However, a SPICE protocol native
+proxy now exists, and a parallel proposal to this one proposes adding support
+for it to Kolla-Ansible. This proxy is called Kerbside, and more details are
+available at https://github.com/shakenfist/kerbside. That is, with the proxy
+deployed there is effectively no change to the network exposure of Nova
+hypervisors.
+
+Use Cases
+---------
+
+*As a developer, I don't want these changes to make the Nova codebase even more
+complicated.* The changes proposed a relatively contained -- a single new API
+microversion, some changes to the domain XML generation code, and associated
+tests.
+
+*As a deployer, I want to be able to use OpenStack to provide rich virtual
+desktops to my users.* This change facilitates such functionality, but does
+require additional deployment steps such as setup to TLS certificates for your
+hypervisors and management of a SPICE native proxy. There is a sample
+implementation using Kolla-Ansible available, but other deployment systems
+would need to integrate this functionality for it to be generally available.
+
+*As a deployer who doesn't want rich desktop consoles, I don't want this
+functionality to complicate my deployment.* When disabled, the changes to
+deployments are minor -- for example the extra USB passthrough devices and
+sound devices in the domain XML are all deployer configurable and can be
+disabled.
+
+*As an end user, I would like access to a richer desktop experience than is
+currently available.* Once these changes are integrated and Kerbside deployed,
+a further change to either Horizon or Skyline will be required to orchestrate
+console access via Kerbside. It is expected the complete end to end
+functionality will take several releases to land before a fully seamless
+experience is available. Once fully implemented, Horizon and Skyline will be
+capable of delivering a `.vv` configuration file for a specific console to a
+client, who will then have seamless access to their virtual desktop.
+
+Proposed change
+===============
+
+As part of prototyping this functionality, a series of patches to Nova were
+developed. These are available at XXX. They are:
+
+  * Allow Nova to require secured SPICE connections, via a new `require_secure`
+    configuration option in the SPICE configuration group.
+  * Add an API microversion to expose SPICE "direct" consoles.
+
+Alternatives
+------------
+
+Unfortunately the SPICE HTML5 proxy does not meet the needs to many remote
+desktop users. Realistically OpenStack does not currently have a way of
+providing these rich desktop consoles to users. Instead, other systems such as
+Citrix are used for this functionality.
+
+Data model impact
+-----------------
+
+None.
+
+REST API impact
+---------------
+
+This specification adds a new console type, "spice-direct", which provides
+the connection information required to talk the native SPICE protocol
+directly to qemu on the hypervisor. This is intended to be fronted
+by a proxy which will handle authentication separately.
+
+A new microversion is introduced which adds the type "spice-direct"
+to the existing "spice" protocol.
+
+An example request:
+
+```
+POST /servers/<uuid>/remote-consoles
+{
+    "remote_console": {
+    "protocol": "spice",
+    "type": "spice-direct"
+    }
+}
+```
+
+An example response:
+
+```
+{
+    "remote_console": {
+    "protocol": "spice",
+    "type": "spice-direct",
+    "host": "localhost",
+    "port": 5900,
+    "tls_port": 5901
+    }
+}
+```
+
+This implies that the JSON schema for `create` console call would change to
+something like this:
+
+```
+create_v297 = {
+    'type': 'object',
+    'properties': {
+        'remote_console': {
+            'type': 'object',
+            'properties': {
+                'protocol': {
+                    'type': 'string',
+                    'enum': ['vnc', 'spice', 'rdp', 'serial', 'mks'],
+                },
+                'type': {
+                    'type': 'string',
+                    'enum': ['novnc', 'xvpvnc', 'spice-html5', 'spice-direct',
+                             'serial', 'webmks'],
+                },
+            },
+            'required': ['protocol', 'type'],
+            'additionalProperties': False,
+        },
+    },
+    'required': ['remote_console'],
+    'additionalProperties': False,
+}
+```
+
+And that the JSON schema for the `get_spice_console` would change to
+something like this:
+
+```
+get_spice_console_v297 = {
+    'type': 'object',
+    'properties': {
+        'os-getSPICEConsole': {
+            'type': 'object',
+            'properties': {
+                'type': {
+                    'type': 'string',
+                    'enum': ['spice-html5', 'spice-direct'],
+                },
+            },
+            'required': ['type'],
+            'additionalProperties': False,
+        },
+    },
+    'required': ['os-getSPICEConsole'],
+    'additionalProperties': False,
+}
+```
+
+For a SPICE direct console, a return value like this would be returned:
+
+```
+{
+    'remote_console': {
+        'protocol': 'spice',
+        'type': 'spice-direct',
+        'host': 'fakespiceconsole.com',
+        'port': 6969,
+        'tls_port': 6970
+    }
+}
+```
+
+Security impact
+---------------
+
+Arguably none. Nova already exposes SPICE consoles on TCP ports on the
+hypervisor. The API functionality to discover the insecure port already exists
+for the purposes of the HTML5 transcoding proxy. While the proposed change
+makes this more directly accessible, it also adds support for TLS encryption
+of the consoles, and would require a misconfigured network to expose these
+ports to end users.
+
+Notifications impact
+--------------------
+
+None.
+
+Other end user impact
+---------------------
+
+None.
+
+Performance Impact
+------------------
+
+None.
+
+Other deployer impact
+---------------------
+
+As discussed, a complete implementation requires deployment systems to
+integrate the Kerbside SPICE proxy, as well as modifications to front ends
+such as Horizon and Skyline to orchestrate consoles via Kerbside. However,
+those are outside the scope of a Nova specification.
+
+The following configuration options are added by the proposed changes:
+
+  * `spice.require_secure`: defaults to `False`, the current hard coded
+    default. Whether to require secure TLS connections to SPICE consoles. If
+    you're providing direct access to SPICE consoles instead of using the
+    HTML5 proxy, you may wish those connections to be encrypted. If so, set
+    this value to True. Note that use of secure consoles requires that you
+    setup TLS certificates on each hypervisor.
+
+  * `spice.allow_concurrent`: defaults to `False`, the current hard coded
+    default. Whether to allow concurrent access to SPICE consoles. SPICE
+    supports multiple users accessing the same console simultaneously, with
+    some reduced functionality for the second and subsequent users. Set this
+    option to True to enable concurrent access to SPICE consoles.
+
+  * `spice.debug_logging`: defaults to `False`, the current hard coded
+    default. Whether to emit SPICE debug logs or not to the qemu log. These
+    debug logs are verbose, but can help diagnose some connectivity issues.
+
+  * `spice.sound_enabled`: defaults to `False`, the current hard coded
+    default. Whether to include a sound device for instance when SPICE
+    consoles are enabled. Configuring this on a per flavor or per image basis
+    was considered, but the additional complexity doesn't seem justified
+    compared to a sound device which emits no sound if the client isn't
+    capable of using it. An `ich6` sound device is always used.
+
+Additionally, if SPICE consoles are enabled, then USB passthrough devices are
+created in the guest. These devices are harmless if not used by a client
+capable of using USB passthrough.
